**What are the characteristics of a multidisciplinary team?**

-   A multidisciplinary team conducts its work based on shared principles
-   Members of the team will have common denominators as well as individual skills
-   When working together, they tend to learn from their peers, who all have a unique set of skills to offer to the group
-   In a multidisciplinary team, co-creation and collaboration are extremely important so that all the different skill sets become complementary to each other
