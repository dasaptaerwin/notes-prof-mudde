A **flat organization** (also known as **horizontal organization** or **flat hierarchy**) has an [organizational structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure "Organizational structure") with few or no levels of middle [management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management "Management") between [staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employees "Employees") and executives. An organization's structure refers to the nature of the distribution of the units and positions within it, also to the nature of the relationships among those units and positions.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization#cite_note-Edwin_E_1972-1) Tall and flat organizations differ based on how many levels of management are present in the organization and how much control managers are endowed with.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_organization#cite_note-Edwin_E_1972-1)
