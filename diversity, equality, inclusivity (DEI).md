> Diversity, at every step along the scientific path, drives innovative research. Scientific societies, like the Geochemical Society (GS) and the European Association of [Geochemistry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/geochemistry "Learn more about Geochemistry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (EAG), have a significant influence over which discoveries and innovators are celebrated. Such choices impact the future of research, and therefore influence the evolution of our discipline and its relationship to the global community.
