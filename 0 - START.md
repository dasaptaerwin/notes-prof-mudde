 # Embrace collaboration, diversity, equality, and inclusion
- famous with [[engineering]], but TUD is aware that it's not a [[monodisciplinary subject]].
- case study in rivers in amsterdam as part of [[local issues]], the study then could be useful for other part of the globe, this is called [[impact]]. what started as engineering problems then identified as [[multidisciplinary]] problems. need the help of [[social science]].
- need to pull all scientific resources to solve local, national, global problems, eg [[climate change]]. we need to see the problem in [[holistic way]].
- complexity of the problem needs [[multidisciplinary]] approach. then [[collaboration is the key]].
- people `working in` and `working with` must involve in [[collaboration]].
- spread wings to embrace other disciplines.
- not only aiming for [[multidisciplinary environment]], we need to also aiming for [[diversity, equality, inclusivity (DEI)]].


# Bring students to multidisciplinary ecosystem
- well [[education for student]], need to train [[socially responsible engineers]].
- students can [[join industry]] to feel [[multidisciplinary ecosystem]] and real world [[problem solving]]. each field has its own role, combined with other fields to solve the problem.
- training in [[communication and team work]].
- must bring students to broad outlook, [[collaborative]] and [[multidisciplinary environment]].
- `note`: [[monodisciplinary vs multidisciplinary]], [[multidisciplinary]], [[crossdisciplinary]], [[interdisciplinary]],  [[transdisciplinarity]]


# Create flat organization
- [[text-flat-organization]] more suitable to tackle [[multidisciplinary]] environment, compared to [[hierarchical structure]].
- [[text-flat-organization]] still needs leadership, [[senior role in coaching not leading]].  
- [[balancing assignment and role]] is a must, we need a system to do it.



# Moving from traditional way in measuring performance
- it's not possible to attain [[excellence]] then sit back, because excellence [[not a olympic medal]].
- need to [[not only be good at what we do, but to be good to create benefit]] to something.
- [[rankings are no longer the goals]]. scientific credits are not only counted based on [[H-index, sum of citations, sum of papers]]. 
- we need to make a [[footprint in impact]] by [[joining international conversation]].
- much effort to create [[impact]] not invite [[impact]] to our door step.
- [[traditional]] academic should move from [[individual]] to a more [[collaborative]] achievement, from [[vertical]] to a more [[text-flat-organization]].
- it's not healthy to work day and night for the university, that can lead to [[potential burn out]].


# Engage with alumni
- Unlike US univs that have more money, common Dutch Universities need to [[innovate for funding]], example [[alumni donation]].
- [[private funding]] from alumni is strategic, important to [[engage with alumni]], be open, [[without hidden agenda]].
- [[Attract not enforce]].
- to attract attention [[not enforcing it, but making it interesting]]. 
- again communication and [[science communication is the key]], make as wide as possible.


# From local issues to create valuable international level knowledge
- working on [[local issues]] to create valuable knowledge in [[international setting]].
- it's their option to use or not, our job is to make it interesting. communication takes important role.

# Teaching vs research

- balance assignment
- all researchers teach and all teachers research.
- university preparation to enter TU DELFT -> to standardize high school graduates
	- ==Sistem MOOC (*self-paced*), hanya dua yang saya temukan==
		- [Pre-university physics](https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/pre-university-physics/)
		- [Pre-university calculus](https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/pre-university-calculus/)
		- _self-paced_ di sini artinya para peserta (siswa SMA) dapat mengikuti kelas secara asinkronus, dengan kecepatan sesuai situasi masing-masing
		- ==sistem MOOC ini dapat dijalankan untuk TPB==


>Dalam salah satu jawaban ke pertanyaan, Prof. Mudde menyebut Ruth Graham, konsultan pendidikan tinggi. Situs webnya [https://www.rhgraham.org/](https://www.rhgraham.org/). Saya sedang pelajari isinya.
